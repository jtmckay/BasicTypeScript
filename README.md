# BasicTypeScript
Basic typescript environment with react

----------Preliminary--------
Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/.
Download this repo by clicking Clone or Download and selecting Download ZIP.
Extract the contents of the zip to a folder you have easy access to.
In that folder (you should see the package.json file), with nothing selected, right click on empty space while holding down shift on the keyboard. You should then be able to select "Open command window here". Or use whatever method is easiest to pull up that folder in the console.
Continue to Existing NodeJS environment.

-------Existing NodeJS environment---------
Run "npm install" in the directory to install all dependencies.
Then type "npm start" to simultaneously run webpack and the node server.
Go to localhost:28880 to see the website.

I would recommend using Atom https://atom.io/
Install atom-typescript for Atom if that's what you are using.
