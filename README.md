# BasicTypeScript
Basic typescript environment with react

Run "npm install" in the directory to install all dependencies.
Then type "npm start" to simultaneously run webpack and the node server.
Go to localhost:28880 to see the website.

I would recommend using Atom https://atom.io/
Install atom-typescript for Atom if that's what you are using.
